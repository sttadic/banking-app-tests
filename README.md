## Description
A simple java Banking Application originally implemented in a single monolithic class, now refactored and accompanied with comprehensive unit tests using *JUnit5*. The application demonstrates common functionalities such as account management, loan processing, and tracking bank-wide deposits, but the primary focus of this project is on refactoring and unit testing rather than the business logic itself.
